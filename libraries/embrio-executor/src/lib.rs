//! A `no_std` compatible, allocation-less, single-threaded futures executor;
//! targeted at supporting embedded use-cases.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! You'll note that the signature for [`Executor::block_on`] takes `&'static
//! mut self`. This is necessary because we can't use reference counting for the
//! wakers like normal allocation-using executors. Instead we have a
//! pre-allocated waker stored in the executor and hand a reference to that out
//! to any future running on it. Because a waker must be an `Arc`-like type,
//! even after the future completes we can't know that there isn't still a live
//! reference, necessitating it to have a `'static` lifetime.
//!
//! There are two ways to use this executor, either statically
//! allocate it or dynamically allocate it and leak it (e.g. with `Box::leak` if
//! you have `std` allocation available). You need a mutable reference, so if
//! statically allocating will need to use either a `static mut` or some target
//! specific form of interior borrowing. If using `static mut` you must be
//! careful of re-entrancy to ensure you don't accidentally create multiple
//! mutable references to the executor.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(const_fn, async_await)]
//! use embrio_executor::Executor;
//!
//! static mut EXECUTOR: Executor = Executor::new();
//!
//! // Safety: We are in a non-reentrant context, so this is the only reference
//! // to the executor that will ever exist.
//! let executor = unsafe { &mut EXECUTOR };
//!
//! assert_eq!(executor.block_on(async { 5 }), 5);
//! ```
